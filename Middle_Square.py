[Middle-square method (1946)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-square_method)

Weakness Note from link ...
For a generator of n-digit numbers, the period can be no longer than 8n. If the middle n digits are all zeroes, the generator then outputs zeroes forever. If the first half of a number in the sequence is zeroes, the subsequent numbers will be decreasing to zero. While these runs of zero are easy to detect, they occur too frequently for this method to be of practical use. The middle-squared method can also get stuck on a number other than zero.
